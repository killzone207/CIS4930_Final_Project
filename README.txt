How to use GitHub:

(1) Download GitHub Desktop Client and log in
(2) Add the repository that I have linked you in your e-mail into the GitHub Client
	->  You'll have to make a folder for this project
(3) Work
	->  Before doing anything, "Sync" the project
	->  After doing anything, "Commit" any uncommitted work
		-> then "Sync" the project so that other members have the updated project.
